  Sustainability in software engineering is crucial when it comes to reducing the environmental footprint of our society. Therefore, creating more efficient and long-lasting software plays a key role in achieving this goal. Governments keep their software open-source, promoting transparency together with collaboration and showing its commitment to accessibility, accountability, and long-term sustainability. However, government open-source projects often lack accessibility, since datasets are often not available, there exist language barriers and often have an absence of incentives for broad usage. These reasons make it hard for researchers to assess the sustainability of these government software projects. For this reason, this project proposes a dataset based on government-developed open-source software in order to make it more accessible for researchers doing research in sustainability practices of government software. The dataset has a focus on sustainability metrics based on development history, buildability and presentence of documentation. Additionally, we propose a dashboard to visualize various repository metrics of the government software projects, providing insights into the overall health, progress, and sustainability of their software projects. By exploring different open-source projects from multiple different countries, this dataset and dashboard provide insights into the sustainability of government software, making improvements in sustainability practices more accessible to researchers and governments.

# Abstract
Sustainability in software engineering is crucial when it comes to reducing the environmental footprint of our society. Therefore, creating more efficient and long-lasting software plays a key role in achieving this goal. Governments keep their software open-source, promoting transparency together with collaboration and showing its commitment to accessibility, accountability, and long-term sustainability. However, government open-source projects often lack accessibility, since datasets are often not available, there exist language barriers and often have an absence of incentives for broad usage. These reasons make it hard for researchers to assess the sustainability of these government software projects. For this reason, this project proposes a dataset based on government-developed open-source software in order to make it more accessible for researchers doing research in sustainability practices of government software. The dataset has a focus on sustainability metrics based on development history, buildability and presentence of documentation. Additionally, we propose a dashboard to visualize various repository metrics of the government software projects, providing insights into the overall health, progress, and sustainability of their software projects. By exploring different open-source projects from multiple different countries, this dataset and dashboard provide insights into the sustainability of government software, making improvements in sustainability practices more accessible to researchers and governments.
